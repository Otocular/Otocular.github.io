                    In this unit, I learned a multitude of coding languages including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    I learned how to create an organized website in HTML, style it in CSS, and even create games with JavaScript.
                    In each of these tasks, I learned how do to do specific things. In HTML, I learned how to start making the content of a website, manage and use divs, sections, and classes.
                    This allowed me to create more complex and interesting website designs, far easier. I also learned how to style this website in CSS.
                    I learned how to edit colors, borders, and even text settings. Finally, I learned many concepts related to game design in JavaScript.
                    I learned how to create and use sprites, variables, and even visual art in this unit. I was able to incorporate all of this into a game, with cohesive controls, and some challenge as well.
                    In conclusion, I learned how to use many coding languages throughout the course of this unit. I learned how to create a website with HTML and CSS, and create a game with JavaScript.
